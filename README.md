<h1>ReactProject</h1>
This is the solo project that I have done in the short timespan of 10 days. It is a complete Full Stack project. The project was taken as a challenge to complete the project in 10 days with necessary functionalities of an E-Com website.

I faced challenges in using Chakra UI, as I was using it for the first time. Apart from this i faced difficulties in connecting backend with frontend. Gradually I overcome this with the help of my peer learners.

The project is deployed here.

Tech Stack:- ReactJS, Redux, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS.
